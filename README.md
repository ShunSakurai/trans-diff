# trans-diff
Create a diff table from different versions of xliff files

### Roadmap
- [ ] Support single file
- [ ] Save comments
- [ ] Support multiple files (detect file IDs)
- [ ] Unzip .mqxlz files

### Motivation and inspiration

Originally I wanted to compare .mqxlz files but the project has been dormant because it was tricky to implement codes to unzip files. I recently often work with Transifex xliff files so I resumed this project.
I was highly inspired and motivated by the diff tool by [AlissaSabre](https://github.com/AlissaSabre), not on GitHub though.
